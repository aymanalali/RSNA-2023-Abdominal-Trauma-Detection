In the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma Detection project we did the following:

1-Developed and optimized a pipeline for medical image analysis.

2-Utilized CNNs to segment abdominal CT scans for trauma detection.

3-Performed preprocessing (cropping, resizing, and segmentation mask generation).

4-Combined 2D slices into 3D volumes for improved accuracy.


In the repository for RSNA-2023-Abdominal-Trauma-Detection, the following libraries are used:

1- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

2- Pandas: For data manipulation.

3- NumPy: For numerical operations.

4- OpenCV: For image processing tasks.

5- Matplotlib: For visualizing results.

6- Pydicom: For handling DICOM images, which are common in medical imaging.
